                    <p>
                        We use Google Analytics to track visitors on this site. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect
                        this data. In order to be compliant with the new regulation Google included a data processing
                        amendment. The data we collect will be processed anonymously and “Data sharing” is disabled. We

                    <p>
                        We employ cookie technology to help visitors and customers move faster through our site. When
                        you sign on to our Web site or take advantage of several key features, we may pass cookies to
                        your computer. A cookie is a string of information that is sent by a Web site and stored on your
                        hard drive or temporarily in your computer’s memory.

                    <h3>Security</h3>
                    <p>
                        The personally identifiable information we collect about you is stored in limited access
                        servers. We will maintain safeguards to protect the security of these servers and your
                        personally identifiable information.

                    <h3>Internet-based Transfers</h3>
                    <p>
                        Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process
                        personal data necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis.
                        Therefore, by browsing https://www.nafau.org and communicating electronically with us
                        you acknowledge and agree to our processing of personal data in this way.

                        We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently.

                        the website. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here that it has
