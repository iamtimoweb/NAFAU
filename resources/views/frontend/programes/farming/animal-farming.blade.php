                            Farmers needs to constantly innovate to maintain the sustainability of the farm
                        </h4>

                        <p>
                            Basing on the size of our organic coffee plantation, we need to constantly innovate to
                            maintain
                            the sustainability of the farm. We find an opportunity to utilize farm organic wastes and
                            residues commonly found within the farm. Hence, it is not uncommon to find the set up of a
                            functional unit of a dairy, piggery, poultry, fishery etc inside the plantation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These units in tandem tend to take care of more than 60 per cent fertilizer needs of the
                            farm.
                            Creation of wealth from organic wastes brings about a holistic healing within the farm and
                            helps
                            maintain a perfect balance between the beneficial and harmful micro and macro fauna and also
                            between man and nature. It is something of a live and let live approach. On the other hand,
                            accumulation of organic wastes results in the build up of complex biologically stable toxic
                            molecules which can cause serious health hazards and environmental pollution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is a matter of great satisfaction that we and our members are enlightened with the
                            technology
                            of converting organic wastes into precious manure and there by maintain the equilibrium of
                            nature. In fact, a visit our coffee demonstration garden, will reveal a story of a
                            biodynamic
                            farm.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Farm wastes, cattle dung, forest litter, goats, poultry, sheep, piggery waste, fish
                            toppings,
                            biogas slurry, green manures and so on are converted into energy rich nutrients which are
                            easily
                            assimilated by coffee plants. Coffee bush is a perennial plant and requires a constant
                            supply of
                            nutrients throughout the year. Recycling organic wastes and addition of organic manures is
                            the
                            right answer to significantly fulfill the plants nutritional requirements from time to time.

                                    The presence of a medium herd of goats and sheep on our organic farm has ensured
                                    abundant quantities of the above mentioned organic manure to be available.
                                </p>

                        <p>
                            The manure from sheep and goat is particularly helpful in quick
                            decomposition of organic residues because of their small size and large surface area.
                            The microbial activity is enhanced resulting in quick breakdown of residues into energy
                            rich nutrients. The nitrogen content is almost 2.75%.

                                    Poultry droppings are a peculiar organic waste because both urine and solid excreta
                                    are
                                    excreted together. Hence there is no loss of nitrogen from urine.

                        <p>
                            These poultry droppings make excellent organic manure because of their excellent C:N
                            ratio as well as high amounts of phosphorus and potash. The manure is also rich in uric
                            acids. Generally for every 25 tons of cattle dung, 7 tons of poultry droppings are mixed
                            along with straw and green manure, composted and broadcasted in the field.

                                    we emphasize the cardinal importance that human beings should be part of nature and
                                    not
                                    above it. Our Farmers living in villages are bubbling with old ideas which work
                                    magnificently on the farm, without depleting the balance of natural resources. Crop
                                    productivity throughout the world relies on the top six inches layer of fertile
                                    soil.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If organic wastes are properly recycled or applied at the right time, it not only
                                    enhances the fertility status of the soil, but converts organic wastes and returns
                                    it
                                    back to the farm in a value added form. This is the least we can give back nature.
                                    Is it
                                    not true that the greatness of nature is in its simplicity? It is only man that has
                                    complicated nature and exploited it. We are locked in an economic race. The way,
                                    nonrenewable energy resources are plundered, the world may soon see shortages of
                                    food
                                    and water.
                                </p>

                                    So it is worthwhile to go back to centuries of traditions practiced by our great
                                    ancestors and analyze the hidden secrets buried within. Reapplying these principles
                                    and
                                    maintaining a sustainable world is the only gift that we can give future
                                    generations.
