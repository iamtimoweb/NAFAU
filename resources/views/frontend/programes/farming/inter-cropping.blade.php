                            The power of coffee banana inter-cropping, Increasing temperatures are having
                            substantial impacts on the suitability of coffee systems across Eastern and Central Africa.

                            On-farm research indicates that growing the two crops together can contribute to all three
                            Climate-Smart Agriculture pillars. In terms of productivity, CBI increases total revenue per
                            unit area by more than 50% compared to mono cropped banana or coffee, without affecting
                            coffee
                            yield. Bananas make coffee production systems more diverse, reducing risk while increasing
                            food
                            security during dry seasons. In newly
                            established coffee farms, bananas can offset cash flow constraints in the early years before
                            the
                            coffee becomes productive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In terms of resilience, bananas provide valuable shade coverage for highly climate-sensitive
                            coffee crops. In addition, bananas are capable of remaining hydrated under drought stress,
                            reducing water competition during drought, compared to other shade trees.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            CBI also mitigates greenhouse gas emissions by increasing above- and below-ground carbon
                            stocks.
                            On average, mixed cropping can sequester around four times the carbon that unshaded mono
                            cultures can. Furthermore, the increased productivity of CBI systems reduces overall carbon
                            footprint, as emissions related to agricultural inputs are spread over a larger agricultural
                            output.
                        </p>

                            In Eastern Uganda, over 85% of coffee farmers have at least one CBI plot. The results were
                            spectacular. However, the downside is that it increases competition among the different
                            plants
                            for water, nutrients and light. This needs to be managed by using good agronomic practices
                            such
                            as integrating fertilizers and organic nutrient inputs, managing plant density and canopy
                            cover
                            appropriately, and practicing good soil and water conservation.
