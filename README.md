# Noah's Ark Farmers Association Uganda
 Noah's Ark Farmers Association Uganda is an umbrella coffee farmers association founded in 2020 as a brain child of [Noah's Ark Children Ministry Uganda](https://www.nacmu.org/) operating within areas of Kayunga, primarily in the villages that make up Kangulumira. NAFAU has grown and evolved as a vibrant private sector led farmer organization formed to serve and position farmers well in the liberalized coffee value chain in Uganda.
